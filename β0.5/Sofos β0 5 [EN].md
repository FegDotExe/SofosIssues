# Sofos Î²0.5 [EN]

# Features

- The bot finally has a name, Sofos!
- Is there something you don't like, or something that you would like to see added? You can let me know all about that, by using [this all new github](https://github.com/FireFlashing/SofosIssues/issues/new). You just need to make a new issue, writing whatever you think, and I'll do my best to help you and consider your ideas.
- Added roles: this doesn't change anything for most people but if you have been amongst the first users, you can expect some special perks in the future
- Added a command for admins to change other people's roles
- Added the /me command, which allows you to see al the infos regarding yourself
- Added a new voice in /settings which allows you to remove warnings (aka the long strings in italics which appear under some texts) if they sting your eye
- Changed the translations to make them way clearer and lighter for the eye
- Changelogs from now on will be here on github!

# Technical

- Added a timeout for researches: if they take too long, the bot will retry connecting to perseus for 5 times, after which it will give up
- Began implementing support for reward calculation: it will be a new way to make coins more easily and to effectively moderate translations
